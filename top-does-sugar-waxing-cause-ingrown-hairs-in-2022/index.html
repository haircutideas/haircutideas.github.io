        <h3>Shaving Or Tweezing Only Removes The Surface Hair Which Means The Root Might Develop More Hair Stems In The Same Follicle.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The reason for it is the lack of proper care. Waxing significantly reduces the chance of ingrowns due to hair being removed from the root instead of chopped at the surface,. This bending backwards of the hair can cause trauma on the hair resulting in a hair that is snapped off instead of being pulled out gently from the root.</p>
        <h3>Taking A Warm Bath Can Also Be An Alternative.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The important conclusion here is that waxing is far less likely to cause ingrown hairs than either waxing or shaving. This treatment for ingrown hair is formulated to clean out pores, replenish moisture, soothe, and prevent future ingrown hairs. A hair lays parallel to the skin under its thin layer.</p>
        <h3>In Fact, Skin Waxing May Help Reduce The Frequency Of Ingrown Hairs.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>As a result, your hair will regrow under your skin, leading to ingrown hairs. Waxing is one of the most common and affordable ways to remove hairs, but it often leads to ingrowns. So to some extent, waxing might not trigger as many ingrown hairs, though it hasn’t.</p>
        <h3>Shaved Hairs May Continue To Grow From The Base, And May End Up Losing Their Direction, Resulting In Ingrown Hairs.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Keep your skin hydrated and frequently nourished to stop the hair from breaking at the surface level when waxing. Moisturize your skin 24 hours before your wax. That is why waxing causes ingrown hairs if not done properly.</p>
        <h3>You May Use A Physical Exfoliator Like A Scrub, Dry Brushing, Or Chemical Exfoliator Like Our Pfb.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>You are at risk of post wasting ingrown hairs if you skip necessary bikini waxing preparation and after care. Also special ingrown hair eliminating lotions help to get. Expect skin to be slightly red after your leg wax—this is normal and can be remedied by applying our ingrown hair serum.</p>
