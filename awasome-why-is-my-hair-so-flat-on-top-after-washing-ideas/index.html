        <h3>Styling Hair In Steamy Bathroom.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Using proper scalp and hair shampoo techniques can help prevent a greasy, overactive scalp. Yet, if you want the most body for your fine hair, it&#039;s best to keep your hair&#039;s length above the collarbone. I think fined haired clients get the most benefit from shampoos.</p>
        <h3>Why Is My Hair So Flat After Washing?</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Okay, so when i do my wash and go&#039;s my hair is super big and curly (around a 2c/3a) right after it finishes drying and then by the next day its almost completely straight with a little bit of curl at the bottom (around a 2a). Technically, the only reason why you have frizzy, poofy hair is because the cuticles of your hair strands are open. Cutting even just a couple of inches off your hair may help.</p>
        <h3>Here Are A Few Additional Tips And Tricks That Have Been Tried And Tested By The Experts Of The Hair Industry:</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Regular showers can cause skin damage. Excess sebum and debris, particularly on your roots, can really weigh your hair down, and can cause scalp issues like dandruff. The best way to detangle frizzy hair is by combing it when it is wet since it helps in combating the dryness of the hair.</p>
        <h3>They Can Easily Make Flat Hair Voluminous Or Very Curly Hair Bone Straight.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Use highly acidic shampoo and conditioners and products used for fine or frequently shampooed hair. Sometimes you might be washing your hair in an apt routine, but the way of washing it might be completely off, thus being the reason your hair feels waxy and greasy after washing. So i&#039;m following a schedule of hair washing (i&#039;m using shampoo 1 day a week and when it gets oily i just use water and conditioner).when i just use conditioner,my hair gets really flat after drying it.i don&#039;t like using styling products on my hair since it ruins the texture.my shampoo is sulfate free and my conditioner is silicone free.anything i could do for some volume?(also drying it with.</p>
        <h3>As Per Millie Morales, Celebrity Hairstylist, ‘The Way You Wash Your Hair Has A Lot To Do With The Way It Behaves.’</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The main culprit behind tangled hair after a shower is dehydration. That’s because your hair absorbs all those mineral deposits while it’s wet in the shower, and as it dries, the minerals crystallize, turning your hair hard and almost crunchy. A surprising number of people have good natural volume, but it&#039;s flattened by the invisible residue from the very products that are supposed to help!</p>
