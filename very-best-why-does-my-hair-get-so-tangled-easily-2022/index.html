    <br/>
    <p>On the one hand it doesn&amp;rsquo;t take too long to dry but on the other hand it is often prone to tangling, especially when the hair is long. Though it might get unnerving at times, try and rinse your hair with cold water so that the cuticles will stay closed and free of twisted knots. There are lots of reasons why hair gets tangled:</p>
        <h3>We Can Boil Down The Causes Of Tangled Hair To A Few Big Culprits:</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Keeping things as natural as possible will help reduce the tangles. Diet eating the correct balance of nutrients is key to keeping hair from getting dry and preventing it from tangling so easily. Always start from the bottom up when getting out knots.</p>
        <h3>Some Types Of Hair Just Tangle More Easily Than Others, Such As High Porosity Hair And Fine Hair.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Children’s hair and people with very fine hair have more problems with tangling than people with a heavier textured hair. Invest in overall hair care: The texture, the length, the condition and health of your hair, the weather (windy days, yikes!), and how often you brush.</p>
        <h3>If Your Hair Is Hard To Brush After Washing, Then It Is Probably Lacking In Moisture, And Frail Hair Gets Matted When Wet.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>However, ladies with straight hair can also face this problem, especially if the hair is long or medium. Then let the mask sink in for a few minutes before rinsing thoroughly. Brush your hair two to three times a day using a soft bristle brush, especially before a shower and before sleeping.</p>
        <h3>There Are Lots Of Reasons Why Hair Gets Tangled:</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Just sleeping on a pillow can rub your hair into a rat&#039;s nest overnight. Unfortunately, roots determine the health of your hair. And when the cuticles are damaged, the hair loses its quality and gets lighter than they already were.</p>
