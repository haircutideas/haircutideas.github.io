All hair grows, it just may seem slow i know people whose front hair grows slower than the back, or middle. Hair shrinkage is when individual strands compress themselves into tight rotations, causing the hair to grow outward.</p>
        <h3>Hormone Deficiency Or Overproduction Can Easily Result In Hair Loss.</h3>
