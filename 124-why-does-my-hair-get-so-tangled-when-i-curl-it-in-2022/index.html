        <h3>Damaged Hair Ends Or Split Ends Often Tangle Easily.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>There are a few possibilities of answers to the question of why is your. If the twig is full of moisture and nourishment, it will bend and hold its shape. The cuticle (the outer layer of the hair), which is responsible for the integrity of the hair structure, is not intact.</p>
        <h3>It&#039;s Pretty Much One Or The Other.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Why does my wavy hair get so tangled? Rinse your locks with cold water. This commonly occurs when you have curls or coarse hair, but it can happen to any type of hair.</p>
        <h3>I&#039;ve Tried Seemingly Everything From Getting A Protein Treatment To Straight Up Cutting My Hair But It&#039;s Still Literally Breaking Off In.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>To do this, work section by section using a round brush. Experts say that while it is natural for the hair to get tangled every once a while, if it happens every day, there may be a problem. A deep conditioner rebuilds the health of your hair by penetrating deeper than a regular conditioner to repair and hydrate from the inside out.</p>
        <h3>If The Twig Is Dried Out, It Will Break And.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Dry curls are prone to tangling because of their structure. This is made from organic ingredients including peppermint oil, aloe vera and jojoba which together get rid of tangles and leave hair feeling soft and shiny instead. This is normally because the water makes your hair heavy and stretched, so it dries straight.</p>
        <h3>The Solution For Both Cases Is To Create A Smooth Coating Over Your Strands.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Dehydration can be solved by using a moisturizing shampoo and avoiding heat tools. Most often, women with curly hair suffer from the problem of knots in hair. Folks with coarse or curly hair tend to experience more tangles as compared to those with fine hair.</p>
