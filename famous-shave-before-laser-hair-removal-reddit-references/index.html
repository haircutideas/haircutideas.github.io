  <meta name="description" content=" Famous Shave Before Laser Hair Removal Reddit References. I&#39;ll be going for my first laser hair removal session this sunday and the laser spa told me to shave the morning of the session. This is because when shaving, the razor can lift the layer of skin as it passes over it.
   — Hair Removal Light and Laser Therapy Choices If... from machohairstyles.tumblr.com  Shaving on the day of training can be dangerous and should be avoided altogether. Laser hair removal works by targeting the melanin in the hair follicle. The hair needs to be there under the skin to be targeted.

        <p>For electro, they need to be able to locate the hair and see the direction of growth. Don’t exfoliate the skin for four to five days after each laser treatment.</p>

        <p>This is another reason why you should leave 24 hours between shaving and your appointment, and you should also take care to use shaving cream or shaving gel. Use a shaving gel (not cream) and soak first in warm water for 10 min.</p>

        <p>Use a shaving gel (not cream) and soak first in warm water for 10 min. Hair grows in cycles, which means some hair may regrow after your session with us, that’s simply because some of the hair may not have experienced the full impact of the laser.</p>

        <h3>They Will Give Instructions That Should Be Followed Before, During, And After The Process.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The laser has to travel from the tip all the way down to the hair follicle, the closer the shave, the closer the distance, which means the treatment will be more effective. Razors get dull, which lead to cuts, abrasions and rashes. It depends on how hard you press on the skin with the razor.</p>
        <h3>Laser Hair Removal Works By Targeting The Melanin In The Hair Follicle.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>I booked 6 sessions, and around my 4th session started to wonder how on earth i’d be able to make that. Laser is tricky to tell if it&#039;s working. Hair grows in cycles, which means some hair may regrow after your session with us, that’s simply because some of the hair may not have experienced the full impact of the laser.</p>
        <h3>Otherwise, It May Start An Outbreak That Could Have Been Dormant For Decades.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>You have to shave before getting laser hair removal, but you have to do it right. I now shave 30 minutes before my session. This is because when shaving, the razor can lift the layer of skin as it passes over it.</p>
        <h3>I Am Due To Have My 3Rd Session Next Week And I Feel A Little Disappointed That In The Past 4 Days.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>So, make sure to wait for several days until the area is no longer sensitive to touch. An expert will discuss with a user who plans to go through a laser hair removal procedure. I’ve been getting laser hair removal for 6 months.</p>
        <h3>First Of All, Don’t Skip Shaving The Day Of Your Treatment!</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Even if the skin doesn’t feel irritated or sensitive, it’s still healing. We also advise that you shave in. This will improve the results of the procedure.</p>
