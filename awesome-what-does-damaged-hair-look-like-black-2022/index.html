        <h3>If Your Hair Is Slightly Damaged, It Is Usually Dry With Less Shine, The Colour Is Duller And Have A Thinner Hair Ends.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Obviously its one of the easiest ways to change the way your hair looks but its far from being the safest. When hair becomes damaged, it can look dull and lackluster, frizzy, unruly, and will tangle more easily—making it nearly impossible to brush through. There are many reasons why your hair lacks elasticity, but the most common is a lack of adequate hydration and proteins.</p>

    <br/>
    <p>The stress on the follicle can weaken it and sometimes cause hair loss says obrien. A poor hygiene routine or a reaction to any of your beard products may cause damage to the root of the beard hair, which may starve it of essential nutrients for growth. While some hair loss is normal, when you see a large increase of it, you can count on damaged hair as being the culprit.</p>

        <h3>Dull, Brittle Hair And Split Ends,” Sitter Says.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Unhealthy hair usually has a rough texture lack of shininess and luster have split ends lack of moisture and elasticity even after treatment and easily broken. Damaged beard hair can also stem from irritated and inflamed skin under the beard. Plus, if your hair is damaged, it will be weak and will therefore fall out a lot easier, so if you’re leaving behind a lot of hair, it might.</p>
        <h3>Damaged Hair Does Not Go Back To Its Natural Form If It Has Been Stretched Out, Unlike Healthy Hair That Is Very Flexible.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Nussbaum shares a simple hack for that. Chemicals like relaxers texturizers and hair color are among the major causes of damaged hair. If the situation becomes more serious, it will have a rougher texture and a dull appearance, the colour balance is more uneven and a more serious split ends.</p>
