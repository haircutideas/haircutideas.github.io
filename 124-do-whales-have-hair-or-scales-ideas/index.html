  <meta name="description" content=" 124&#43; Do Whales Have Hair Or Scales Ideas. Toothed whales usually have hair along their snout before they are born and lose them completely shortly after birth. Now the fish in the sea are another story.
   Humpback wale Animali from www.pinterest.com  Since cetaceans are mammals, they have hair at some point in their life! For example, the tail fin of a humpback whale is covered in hair, while the rest of the whale is smooth. As a marine mammal whales share several features that are common among “almost” all mammals such as the need to breathe air, giving birth.

        <p>There are some exceptions—some of the greater whales have bristles on their faces and the tubercles (or bumps) on a humpback whale&#039;s head contain very stiff whiskers. These scales look more like teeth than actual scales and help the whale shark decrease drag to ensure they can glide.</p>

        <h3>Scientists Do Not Yet Know What Exactly.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Most whales and dolphins must rise to the surface often to take in oxygen from the air through their blowhole. Killer whale, dolphin, porpoise, and sperm whale teeth are modified bones in their skull and jaw, just like ours. Do whales have hair or scales.</p>
        <h3>Instead The Bodies Of Cetaceans Are Covered With Slick And Rubbery Skin Which Allows Them To Swim With Minimal Friction Acting Against Them.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Baleen whales are no exception and have vibrissae on the chin, muzzle and jaw, a little like a patchy beard. No they do not have hair. There are some exceptions—some of the greater whales have bristles on their faces and the tubercles (or bumps) on a humpback whale&#039;s head contain very stiff whiskers.</p>
        <h3>They Are Found Along The Jawline On The Upper And Lower Jaw, On The Chin, Along The Midline On Top Of The Head, And Sometimes Along The Blowhole.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Whales having hair on their bodies sounds a bit surprising, but the fact is that, yes, whales do have hair on their bodies. The water they live in is very murky so eyesight has only limited use. Fin whales, sei whales, right whales, and bowhead whales.</p>
        <h3>The Body Of A Turtle Is Mostly Covered By The Shell, The Only Parts Left Exposed Are The Neck, Head, Tail, And Legs.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The thick hairs inside a human’s nostrils are also vibrissae. In fact, some parts of the whale’s body have more hair than others. See answer (1) best answer.</p>
        <h3>Whales And Dolphins Have Bristles, Which Are Short, Rough Hairs.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Baleen whales known to have hair follicles as adults include humpback, fin, sei, right, and bowhead whales. The answer, in short, is “no.”. Toothed whales usually have hair along their snout before they are born and lose them completely shortly after birth.</p>
