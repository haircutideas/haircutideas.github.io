Woke up one morning, to find a large patch of hair had disappeared from the corners of my frontal hairline.
   Suffering from excessive hair loss post accutane. I am shedding 300 from www.reddit.com  It may be best to speak with a doctor about any upcoming cosmetic procedures while taking isotretinoin. Many people who use accutane (isotretinoin) for acne are aware that it can cause severe hair loss. Rogaine may help improve hair loss, but it also drys the scalp further.

    <br/>
    <p>It is still falling out and now it is starting to become noticeable. I took accutane in my teens and had severe side effects from the drug. It occurs several months after the trigger, which is the drug, so you will.</p>
        <h3>One Of The Possible Side Effects Of Accutane Is The Thinning Of Hair.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Our results support that the drug does not alter hair growth parameters in the short term and when very high doses are not used. I was on a very high dose and took more than the recommended amount during those couple weeks because i thought i would get better results. Isotretinoin may cause side effects, including hair loss.</p>
        <h3>I Am 27 Years Old And Began Losing Hair Around Age 21 Immediately After Using The Drug Accutane.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>For people with adult female acne (afa), i.e., women over the age of 25 with stubborn, persistent, hormonal acne, some dermatologists will prescribe a lower dose of accutane over a longer period. Accutane has been linked to a decrease in zinc in some patients, making you more susceptible to hair loss issues. I hope you will read this story, as i believe it will help the people out there who are sick from accutane.</p>
        <h3>Rogaine May Help Improve Hair Loss, But It Also Drys The Scalp Further.</h3>

        <h3>Woke Up One Morning, To Find A Large Patch Of Hair Had Disappeared From The Corners Of My Frontal Hairline.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>This is unsurprising, due to the structural similarities between accutane and vitamin a, which is known to cause hair loss in high doses. In my experience, my hair loss slowed down when i was on accutane. Accutane was used for years to treat acne, an often physically and emotionally devastating skin condition.</p>
