        <h3>The Hairs On Your Face, Or Even Just On Parts Of Your Face, Don’t Always Match What’s On Your Head.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Eumelanin (black pigment) and pheomelanin (red pigment). So just because your father, uncle or grandfather rocked a dark. So, if you have random red hairs in your beard, one of your ancestors likely had red hair and passed the mc1r gene down to you.</p>
        <h3>Beard Dream Explanation — If It Grows Longer Than One&#039;s.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>A mutation in one of those genes causes different colored hair to pop up in. We all inherit one type of mc1r from each of our parents. One&#039;s beard in a dream also could represent his wife.</p>
        <h3>When A Person Inherits Two Mutated Mc1R Genes.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>But for others, it can be striking. A singular mutated mc1r gene causes partial red hair. The surprise red beard occurs because of that same mutation in the mc1r gene.</p>
        <h3>Namely, The Ratio Of Eumelanin To Pheomelanin.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Two mutated mc1r genes produce red hair all over. The pigment melanin in our body is responsible for giving us the color. This pigment is subject to changes.</p>
        <h3>The Reason Behind The Cause Of Red Beard Is The Mutation Of Genes.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>So, it’s totally possible (and pretty common) to have a red beard when no one else in your family has. Scientifically speaking, your red beard is a result of a gene mutation. If you only inherited one mutated gene instead of two, there’s a higher chance you’ll have red hair in unexpected places, like your beard, and not on your head.</p>
