        <h3>“Make Sure You Change Your Hair Products With The Seasons, Marinelli Said.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Try other shampoos and conditioners that may be better for your hair type; I&#039;d say it&#039;s unusual, it could be due to a great variety of things. The mask combats dullness and dryness caused by environmental elements and works.</p>
        <h3>Use The Right Hair Care Products:</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>My hair feels like straw. Maybe take a good vitamin &amp; mineral supplement. Using heat tools like curling irons, hair straighteners, blow dryers, etc., on your hair can fry it.</p>
        <h3>I Am 16 Years Old So I&#039;d Better Start Early!</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Using drying and styling tools (dryers, curling irons, electric rollers, flat irons) at too high a heat setting. Nutrient deficiencies, weight loss and eating disorders such as bulimia or anorexia can lead to dry hair or hair loss. My hair feels very dry and i am not sure why.</p>
        <h3>Take At Last 3,000 Mg/Day.</h3>

        <h3>The First Could Be That Its So Dried Out From Either Heat Styling Or From Environmental Conditions.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Shampooing the hair too often does not allow the formation of sebum produced by the scalp to. Any advice on how to make my hair softer? Since starting, i have done 1 regular wash (day 1) with cream of nature shampoo and a deep conditioning treatment with aussie 3 minute miracle.</p>
