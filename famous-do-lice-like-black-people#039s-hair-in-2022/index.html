    <br/>
    <p>The nit, the nymph, and the adult. It is believed that 12 million people, including black americans, are afflicted with head lice each year. In fact, often some of the most severe infestations we see are in individuals with african american hair.</p>
        <h3>However, The Coily Hair Of Black People Is Less Infested With Head Lice.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Ethnicity, color, age, and sex don’t affect lice to stop spreading. Just like any other group of people, african americans can be susceptible to getting lice if they come into contact with someone who has lice or if they share personal items (such as brushes, combs, or towels) with someone who has lice.
